abstract = {A cerebrovascular accident or stroke is the second commonest cause of death in the world. If it is not fatal, it can result in paralysis, sensory impairment and significant disability. Rehabilitation plays an important role to help survivors relearn lost skills and assist them to regain independence and thus ameliorate their quality of life. With the development of technology, researchers have come up with new solutions to assist clinicians in monitoring and assessing their patients; as well as making physiotherapy available to all. The objective of this review is to assess the recent developments made in the field of post-stroke rehabilitation using wearable devices for data collection and machine learning algorithms for the exercises’ evaluation. To do so, PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Scopus, Lens, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Microsoft academic were electronically searched. Peer-reviewed papers using sensors in post-stroke rehabilitation were included, for the period between 2015 to August 2021. Thirty-three publications that used wearable sensors for patients’ assessment were included. Based on that, we have proposed a taxonomy that divided the assessment systems into three categories namely activity recognition, movement classification, and clinical assessment emulation. Moreover, The most commonly employed sensors as well as the most targeted body–limbs, outcome measures, and study designs are reviewed, in addition to the examination of the machine learning approaches starting from the feature engineering to the classification done. Finally, limitations and potential study directions in the field are presented.}

	abstract = {The brain–computer interface ({BCI}) is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the world, with numerous applications ranging from healthcare to human augmentation. Electroencephalogram ({EEG}) motor imagery ({MI}) is among the most common {BCI} paradigms that have been used extensively in smart healthcare applications such as post-stroke rehabilitation and mobile assistive robots. In recent years, the contribution of deep learning ({DL}) has had a phenomenal impact on {MI}-{EEG}-based {BCI}. In this work, we systematically review the {DL}-based research for {MI}-{EEG} classification from the past ten years. This article first explains the procedure for selecting the studies and then gives an overview of {BCI}, {EEG}, and {MI} systems. The {DL}-based techniques applied in {MI} classification are then analyzed and discussed from four main perspectives: preprocessing, input formulation, deep learning architecture, and performance evaluation. In the discussion section, three major questions about {DL}-based {MI} classification are addressed: (1) Is preprocessing required for {DL}-based techniques? (2) What input formulations are best for {DL}-based techniques? (3) What are the current trends in {DL}-based techniques? Moreover, this work summarizes {MI}-{EEG}-based applications, extensively explores public {MI}-{EEG} datasets, and gives an overall visualization of the performance attained for each dataset based on the reviewed articles. Finally, current challenges and future directions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The electroencephalogram ({EEG}) based motor imagery ({MI}) signal classification, also known as motion recognition, is a highly popular area of research due to its applications in robotics, gaming, and medical fields. However, the problem is ill-posed as these signals are non-stationary and noisy. Recently, a lot of efforts have been made to improve {MI} signal classification using a combination of signal decomposition and machine learning techniques but they fail to perform adequately on large multi-class datasets. Previously, researchers have implemented long short-term memory ({LSTM}), which is capable of learning the time-series information, on the {MI}-{EEG} dataset for motion recognition. However, it can not model very long-term dependencies present in the motion recognition data. With the advent of transformer networks in natural language processing ({NLP}), the long-term dependency issue has been widely addressed. Motivated by the success of transformer algorithms, in this article, we propose a transformer-based deep learning neural network architecture that performs motion recognition on the raw {BCI} competition {III} {IVa} and {IV} 2a datasets. The validation results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method produces classification accuracy of 99.7\% and 84\% on the binary class and the multi-class datasets, respectively. Further, the performance of the proposed transformer-based model is also compared with {LSTM}.},

abstract="The frontal lobes are anatomically defined by the central fissure at their posterior border as it is proximal to the somatosensory cortex of the parietal lobe. Anatomical landmarks exposed on the lateral surfaces of the frontal lobes include the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri. A gyrus is a cortical ridge surrounded by sulci or grooves produced with a folding of the surface of the brain to increase surface area. Prominent anatomical regions within the frontal lobes, which have been the subject of much research, include the motor cortex anterior to the central fissure, the premotor cortex anterior to the motor cortex, the prefrontal regions and frontal eye fields, the supplementary motor region, the orbitofrontal region, the cingulate gyrus, and the frontal poles. It is fair to say that the frontier of neuroscience and clinical research corresponds with the anterior-most regions of the frontal lobes: the frontal poles and the orbitofrontal and the basal frontal regions.",
