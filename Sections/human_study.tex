% evaluation of the model in a realtime scenario with real people
I really wanted to ``close the loop'' of the evaluation by including the human in it, because I was interested in the interaction between human and the system.
Technical performances may pose some problems, but I want to get the whole picture.
later it is possible to iterate over everything to improve.
Study with eeg cap.
