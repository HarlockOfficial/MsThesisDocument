\chapter{Schedule}\label{ch:schedule}
To proceed with the implementation of the system, a schedule is necessary.
This schedule will provide a clear understanding of the project's timeline and the tasks that will be performed during the implementation.
This section will present the schedule of the project, including the tasks, the timeline, and the milestones that will be achieved during the implementation.

\section{Tasks}
The project will be divided into several tasks, each one with a specific goal and a set of deliverables.
The tasks will be divided into four main categories: the state of the art study, the development of the game, the implementation of the neural network, and the integration of the game and the neural network.
The state of the art study will be the first task, and it will provide a clear understanding of the current state of the art in the field of BCI and EEG-based games.
The development of the neural network will be the second task, and it will provide a clear understanding of the best neural network architecture for the classification of the player's movement intentions.
The development of the game will be the third task, and it will provide a clear understanding of the best game mechanics for the implementation of the system.
The integration of the game and the neural network will be the fourth task, and it will provide a clear understanding of the best pipeline for the integration of the game and the neural network.

\section{Timeline}
The project will be divided into several phases, each one with a specific timeline and a set of tasks.
The first phase will be the state of the art study, and it will last for two weeks.
The second phase will be the development of the neural networks and the selection of the best architecture, and it will last for six weeks.
The third phase will be the development of the game and the selection of the best game mechanics, and it will last for six weeks.
The fourth phase will be the integration of the game and the neural network, and it will last for three weeks.
The fifth phase will be the testing and validation of the system, and it will last for three weeks.
The sixth phase will be the writing of the dissertation, and it will last for two weeks.
